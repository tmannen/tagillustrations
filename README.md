# Tag illustrations

[illustration2vec](http://illustration2vec.net) is a pretrained neural network for tagging illustrations. I'm using caffe to tag local images. It also contains a webapp written with Flask to display images with a tag (similar to Gelbooru).

Example (tag was automatically generated):
