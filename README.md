# Tag illustrations

[illustration2vec](http://illustration2vec.net) is a pretrained neural network for tagging illustrations. The caffe model takes an image as an input and and generates tags for it. The code can be used to tag local images. It also contains a webapp written with Flask to display images with a tag (similar to Danbooru).
