# Tag illustrations

[illustration2vec](http://illustration2vec.net) is a pretrained neural network for tagging illustrations. I'm using the provided caffe model to tag local images. It also contains a webapp written with Flask to display images with a tag (similar to Danbooru).

Example (tag was automatically generated from the picture):

![Searching for the character 'holo' from the tags](examples/examplepic.png?raw=true "i2v correctly tags these images")
